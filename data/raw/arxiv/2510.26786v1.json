    "summary": "Hierarchical structures of motion exist across research fields, including\ncomputer vision, graphics, and robotics, where complex dynamics typically arise\nfrom coordinated interactions among simpler motion components. Existing methods\nto model such dynamics typically rely on manually-defined or heuristic\nhierarchies with fixed motion primitives, limiting their generalizability\nacross different tasks. In this work, we propose a general hierarchical motion\nmodeling method that learns structured, interpretable motion relationships\ndirectly from data. Our method represents observed motions using graph-based\nhierarchies, explicitly decomposing global absolute motions into\nparent-inherited patterns and local motion residuals. We formulate hierarchy\ninference as a differentiable graph learning problem, where vertices represent\nelemental motions and directed edges capture learned parent-child dependencies\nthrough graph neural networks. We evaluate our hierarchical reconstruction\napproach on three examples: 1D translational motion, 2D rotational motion, and\ndynamic 3D scene deformation via Gaussian splatting. Experimental results show\nthat our method reconstructs the intrinsic motion hierarchy in 1D and 2D cases,\nand produces more realistic and interpretable deformations compared to the\nbaseline on dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting scenes. By providing an adaptable,\ndata-driven hierarchical modeling paradigm, our method offers a formulation\napplicable to a broad range of motion-centric tasks.
