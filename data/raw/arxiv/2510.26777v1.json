    "summary": "Recent research on time series foundation models has primarily focused on\nforecasting, leaving it unclear how generalizable their learned representations\nare. In this study, we examine whether frozen pre-trained forecasting models\ncan provide effective representations for classification. To this end, we\ncompare different representation extraction strategies and introduce two\nmodel-agnostic embedding augmentations. Our experiments show that the best\nforecasting models achieve classification accuracy that matches or even\nsurpasses that of state-of-the-art models pre-trained specifically for\nclassification. Moreover, we observe a positive correlation between forecasting\nand classification performance. These findings challenge the assumption that\ntask-specific pre-training is necessary, and suggest that learning to forecast\nmay provide a powerful route toward constructing general-purpose time series\nfoundation models.",
