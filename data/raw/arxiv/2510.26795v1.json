    "summary": "Determining the precise geographic location of an image at a global scale\nremains an unsolved challenge. Standard image retrieval techniques are\ninefficient due to the sheer volume of images (>100M) and fail when coverage is\ninsufficient. Scalable solutions, however, involve a trade-off: global\nclassification typically yields coarse results (10+ kilometers), while\ncross-view retrieval between ground and aerial imagery suffers from a domain\ngap and has been primarily studied on smaller regions. This paper introduces a\nhybrid approach that achieves fine-grained geo-localization across a large\ngeographic expanse the size of a continent. We leverage a proxy classification\ntask during training to learn rich feature representations that implicitly\nencode precise location information. We combine these learned prototypes with\nembeddings of aerial imagery to increase robustness to the sparsity of\nground-level data. This enables direct, fine-grained retrieval over areas\nspanning multiple countries. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates that our\napproach can localize within 200m more than 68\\% of queries of a dataset\ncovering a large part of Europe.
